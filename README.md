Title: Analysis of E-commerce data from Multi category stores (e.g. Apple, HP, ASUS) to understand user behavior and patterns using
Big data technologies.

Platform: Python, AWS S3, AWS EMR, PySpark, AWS Athena, AWS Glue, Power BI

1.Using big data techniques, we analyzed e-commerce data from multicategory stores.
2.By leveraging AWS EMR, AWS S3, PySpark, AWS Glue, and Athena we were able to efficiently process and analyze the data,
  uncovering trends and patterns that traditional methods would have missed.
3.Our insights into customer behavior and preferences can be leveraged by the e-commerce store to improve their business
  strategies and enhance customer satisfaction.
4.Our project focused on building a streamlined data pipeline to analyze the dataset. First, we ingested the data into an S3 bucket
  and created tables in Athena using Glue crawlers to analyze the schema. Next, we used AWS EMR with Spark and Hadoop to
  clean and analyze the data, utilizing PySpark DataFrame for data processing and cleaning.
5.The cleaned data was then stored in AWS S3 (Data warehouse) and connected to Power BI to generate an intuitive & userfriendly dashboard.
